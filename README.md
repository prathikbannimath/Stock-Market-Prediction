Prediction of Stock Prices using LSTM(Long Short Memory Networks)

Here I have Predicted the price of the APPL stock in USD. Took stock prices from 2012 to mid 2018 from directly from yahoo. And trained the LSTM model to predict the stock prices from mid 2018 to 2020. The RMSE (Root mean square Error) for the model came to be 2.81. And the predictions came pretty close to the real stock values.
